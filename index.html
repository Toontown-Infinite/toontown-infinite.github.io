        <h4>Background information</h4>
        <p>In early April, we evaluated the future of Toontown Infinite. We believed that the community created around our small private server was great, and that it had a lot to offer. However, we came to the unfortunate realization that while we had
          a loyal set of players, there wasn’t much internal interest in continuing the development of the game. Additionally, we had been having issues securing funding for servers to keep the project alive.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Sad news</h4>
        <p>With all of this considered, we made the hard decision to stop all development on Infinite, and to close down the project. We know that this can be hard to hear, especially for players that have invested time into the game. To help ease the
          transition, the server was kept live until April 13th so that our players could make an easier transition over to the server of their choice.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>I can pay for the servers though</h4>
        <p>It doesn't matter. Even if someone were willing to donate money, we already said we're going through with shutting down the servers, and that doesn't change our interest in developing and supporting Toontown.
        </p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h4>Will you open source the game</h4>
        <p>No. The community doesn't need a dozen spin-offs. The only open source version will be the one from
          <a href="https://github.com/ToontownInfinite/src" target="_blank">January 2015.</a> Play
          <a href="https://toontownrewritten.com" target="_blank">Toontown Rewritten</a> or come up with an original idea for the game, but please don't just rehost ours.</p>
        <p>However, the website is open sourced
          <a href="https://github.com/brandonberney/toontown-infinite-website" target="_blank">here.</a> I hope someone can learn from it [also note that the site was never fully finished, and i'm not happy with it].</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Will we ever see a return</h4>
        <p>No. All data on the servers (accounts, toons, support tickets, etc.) will be destroyed after closing. We do not want to see another reincarnation of the game.</p>


        <br>
        <h4>What are you going to do with toontowninfinite.com</h4>
        <p>I don't know. It's registered practically for another year, until March 2017. Send me an email:
          <a href="mailto:brandon@toontowninfinite.com">brandon@toontowninfinite.com</a>. Maybe we can work something out.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Closing notes</h4>
        <p>We want to recognize the work of everyone on the project that made this game great, and thank them for their hard work. And of course, we would like to thank everyone who has played Infinite over the last couple years. Without you, there would
          have been no Infinite.</p>
